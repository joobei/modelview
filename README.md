# modelview
View a 3d model controlled by the extended tuiodroid app.

This is the source code that accompanies this interactive technique: http://www.hcis-journal.com/content/5/1/22

The android client is based on TUIOdroid by Tobias Schwirten and Martin Kaltenbrunner and can be found at https://github.com/joobei/tuiodroidextend

The current CMakeFile.txt is meant for Mac OSX but slight modification will let it compile on other platforms.
