# Modelview (with Photonio rendering engine)
C++ OpenGL/GLSL Multi-Threaded engine to View a 3d model controlled by the extended tuiodroid app.

The android client is based on TUIOdroid by Tobias Schwirten and Martin Kaltenbrunner and can be found at https://github.com/joobei/tuiodroidextend

The current CMakeFile.txt is meant for Mac OSX but slight modification will allow it to compile on other platforms.
